Linting in Python can be done with the help of, for example, Flake8 or Pylint, which can detect both logical and stylistic lint. Testing in Python can be done with the help of unittest, which is built into the Python standard library since version 2.1, or pytest, which supports execution of  not just unittest test cases but also series of functions. Another framework for testing is RedwoodHQ, which is compatible with continuous integration tools, and is suitable for both front-end and back-end testing.Tools for building include PyBuilder, Buildout and doit. 
One of the open source alternatives to set up the CI is GoCD, which allows continuous delivery and provides an intuitive interface for building CD pipelines. Another alternative is Buddy, which makes it very easy to build, test, and deploy quality software faster. It also supports all popular languages & frameworks as well as Docker and Kubernetes.
In order to know would the setup be better in a self-hosted or a cloud-based environment for this application it would be important to know the size of the project as well as future development planning. In addition, it is essential to know whether the project would have any special requirements. Since the team working on this project is relatively small (6 people) it can be assumed that it is a small to medium software project, so unless it has any special requirements a cloud-based environment should be a good choice.
